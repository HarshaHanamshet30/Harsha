Data Science Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This is a collection of my projects, experiments, and practice work as I explore various data science, analytics, and software engineering concepts. Below you will find descriptions of some of the key projects included in this repository.

Projects
1. House Price Prediction
This project involves predicting house prices using machine learning algorithms. The model was trained on a dataset with features such as location, size, and amenities. Techniques such as linear regression, decision trees, and random forests were used to improve the accuracy of predictions.

2. Stock Market Analysis and Prediction
A comprehensive analysis of stock market trends, with predictive models that forecast future stock prices. The project utilizes time series analysis, ARIMA models, and machine learning techniques to analyze stock data.

3. Diwali Sales Analysis
An insightful analysis of Diwali sales data, focusing on trends and patterns based on state, product, and gender. This project uses data visualization and statistical methods to uncover key insights and help businesses make informed decisions.
